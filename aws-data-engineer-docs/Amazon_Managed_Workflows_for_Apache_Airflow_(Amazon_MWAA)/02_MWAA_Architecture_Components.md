# MWAA Architecture and Components

## MWAA Architecture Overview

Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow (MWAA) is a managed orchestration service for Apache Airflow that simplifies the process of setting up and operating Airflow environments on AWS. MWAA allows users to create and manage workflows that orchestrate cloud applications, data pipelines, and machine learning models seamlessly.

## Key Components

### 1. Environment

The **Environment** is the foundational component of MWAA. It encapsulates all the necessary resources and configurations required to run Apache Airflow. When you create an MWAA environment, AWS provisions the following:

- **Web Server**: Hosts the Airflow UI and allows users to interact with the Airflow environment.
- **Scheduler**: Manages the scheduling and execution of DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs).
- **Workers**: Execute the tasks defined within DAGs.
- **Metadata Database**: Stores metadata about DAGs, tasks, and their execution states.
- **S3 Bucket**: Used for storing logs, DAGs, and other artifacts.

### 2. Workers

**Workers** are the components responsible for executing the tasks defined in your DAGs. MWAA automatically scales the number of workers based on the workload, ensuring that tasks are executed efficiently without manual intervention.

### 3. Schedulers

The **Scheduler** is responsible for monitoring the state of the DAGs and triggering task executions based on their dependencies and schedules. It ensures that tasks are executed at the right time and in the correct order.

## Network Architecture

MWAA environments are deployed within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), allowing for secure and isolated network configurations. Key aspects of the network architecture include:

- **VPC**: MWAA environments are launched within a customer-specified VPC.
- **Subnets**: Environments span across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) for high availability.
- **Security Groups**: Control inbound and outbound traffic to the MWAA environment.
- **NAT Gateways**: Enable internet access for resources within private subnets.

## Security Components

Security is a critical aspect of MWAA, and several components ensure the environment is secure:

- **IAM Roles**: MWAA uses IAM roles for authentication and authorization, allowing it to interact with other AWS services.
- **Encryption**: Data at rest and in transit is encrypted using AWS managed keys or customer-managed keys via AWS KMS.
- **VPC Endpoints**: Private endpoints for AWS services to ensure that network traffic remains within the AWS network.
- **Audit Logging**: CloudTrail logs capture API calls made to MWAA for auditing purposes.

## Integration with AWS Services

MWAA is designed to integrate seamlessly with a wide range of AWS services, enhancing its functionality and use cases:

- **Amazon S3**: Used for storing DAGs, plugins, and logs.
- **Amazon RDS**: Can be used as a metadata database for Airflow.
- **AWS Lambda**: Execute serverless functions as part of your workflows.
- **Amazon SQS**: Integrate with queues for task messaging.
- **Amazon SageMaker**: Orchestrate machine learning workflows.
- **AWS Step Functions**: Combine with Airflow for complex workflow orchestration.

By leveraging these integrations, users can build robust, scalable, and secure data pipelines and workflows using MWAA.

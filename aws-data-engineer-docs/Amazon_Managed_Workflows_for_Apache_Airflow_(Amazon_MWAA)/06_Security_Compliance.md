# Security and Compliance in Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow (MWAA)

Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow (MWAA) provides robust security features and compliance capabilities to ensure the protection of your data and workflows. This document outlines the key security and compliance aspects of MWAA.

## IAM Roles and Permissions

MWAA leverages AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to control access to your workflows and resources. Key IAM roles and permissions include:

- **MWAA Execution Role**: This role is assumed by MWAA to perform actions on your behalf. It should have the necessary permissions to access other AWS services, such as Amazon S3, Amazon RDS, and Amazon SQS.
- **MWAA Service Role**: This role is used by the MWAA service to manage your environment. It requires permissions to create and manage resources within your AWS account.
- **User Permissions**: IAM users or groups should be granted permissions to interact with MWAA through the AWS Management Console, CLI, or SDKs. Use the `AmazonMWAAFullAccess` managed policy or create custom policies to grant specific permissions.

## Network Security

MWAA environments can be configured to enhance network security:

- **VPC Endpoints**: Use VPC endpoints to enable private connectivity between MWAA and other AWS services without requiring access over the public internet.
- **Security Groups**: Apply security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic to your MWAA environment. Restrict access to only necessary ports and sources.
- **Network ACLs**: Use network ACLs to add an additional layer of security by controlling traffic to and from subnets within your VPC.

## Data Encryption

MWAA provides several options for data encryption to protect your data at rest and in transit:

- **Encryption at Rest**: MWAA environments encrypt data at rest using AWS Key Management Service (KMS). You can use either the default AWS-managed CMK or a customer-managed CMK for enhanced control.
- **Encryption in Transit**: MWAA uses Transport Layer Security (TLS) to encrypt data in transit between the MWAA environment and other AWS services.

## Security Best Practices

Adhere to the following security best practices when using MWAA:

- **Least Privilege**: Grant the minimum necessary permissions to IAM roles and users.
- **Regular Audits**: Periodically review and audit IAM roles, permissions, and security configurations.
- **Environment Isolation**: Use separate MWAA environments for development, testing, and production to isolate workloads and reduce the risk of cross-contamination.
- **Patch Management**: Ensure that your MWAA environment and dependencies are up to date with the latest security patches and updates.

## Compliance Standards

MWAA complies with various industry standards and regulations, including:

- **SOC**: MWAA is compliant with the Service Organization Control (SOC) standards, which provide assurance on the controls surrounding security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy.
- **HIPAA**: For workloads handling protected health information (PHI), MWAA can be used in compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).
- **GDPR**: MWAA supports General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) compliance by providing features for data encryption, access control, and audit logging.

## Audit Logging

MWAA integrates with AWS CloudTrail to provide detailed audit logs of API calls made to your MWAA environment. Key audit logging features include:

- **API Call Logging**: CloudTrail logs all API calls made to MWAA, including actions such as creating, updating, and deleting environments.
- **User Activity**: Logs capture user activity within the MWAA environment, such as triggering DAGs and accessing the Airflow UI.
- **Configuration Changes**: Audit logs record changes to MWAA configurations, such as updates to network settings or encryption keys.

By following these security and compliance guidelines, you can ensure that your MWAA environments are secure, compliant, and resilient against potential threats.

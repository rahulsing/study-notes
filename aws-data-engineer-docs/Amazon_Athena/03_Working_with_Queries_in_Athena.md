# Working with Queries in Athena

## Introduction

Amazon Athena is an interactive query service that makes it easy to analyze data in Amazon S3 using standard SQL. This guide aims to provide a comprehensive overview of writing and optimizing queries in Athena, covering SQL syntax, query optimization techniques, and best practices.

## Athena's SQL Syntax and Supported Data Types

Athena supports a wide range of SQL syntax and data types. Hereâs a quick overview:

### Data Types

- **Primitive Types**: `BOOLEAN`, `TINYINT`, `SMALLINT`, `INT`, `BIGINT`, `FLOAT`, `DOUBLE`, `DECIMAL`, `DATE`, `TIMESTAMP`, `STRING`, `VARCHAR`, `CHAR`, `BINARY`, `ARRAY`, `MAP`, `STRUCT`.
- **Complex Types**: `ARRAY<T>`, `MAP<K,V>`, `STRUCT<col1:type1, col2:type2, ...>`.

### Functions and Operators

- **Scalar Functions**: `ABS`, `SQRT`, `SIN`, `COS`, `LENGTH`, `SUBSTR`, `UPPER`, `LOWER`, `TRIM`, `CURRENT_DATE`, `DATE_ADD`, `DATE_DIFF`, etc.
- **Aggregate Functions**: `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`.
- **Conditional Functions**: `CASE`, `COALESCE`, `NULLIF`.
- **Operators**: Arithmetic (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`), Comparison (`=`, `<>`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`), Logical (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`).

## Query Optimization Techniques

### Partitioning

Partitioning your data can significantly improve query performance by reducing the amount of data scanned.

sql
CREATE TABLE sales (
  sale_id BIGINT,
  product_id BIGINT,
  sale_date DATE,
  amount DOUBLE
)
PARTITIONED BY (sale_year INT, sale_month INT);
```

### Bucketing

Bucketing organizes data into a specified number of buckets based on the values of a column.

```sql
CREATE TABLE sales_bucketed (
  sale_id BIGINT,
  product_id BIGINT,
  sale_date DATE,
  amount DOUBLE
)
CLUSTERED BY (product_id) INTO 10 BUCKETS;
```

### Compression

Using compression formats like `Parquet` or `ORC` can reduce storage costs and improve query performance.

```sql
CREATE TABLE sales_parquet (
  sale_id BIGINT,
  product_id BIGINT,
  sale_date DATE,
  amount DOUBLE
)
STORED AS PARQUET;
```

### Filtering

Apply filters early in your query to reduce the amount of data processed.

```sql
SELECT sale_id, product_id, amount
FROM sales
WHERE sale_date BETWEEN '2021-01-01' AND '2021-12-31'
  AND amount > 100;
```

## Advanced SQL Concepts

### Joins

Athena supports various types of joins: `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, `FULL OUTER JOIN`.

```sql
SELECT s.sale_id, p.product_name, s.amount
FROM sales s
INNER JOIN products p ON s.product_id = p.product_id;
```

### Window Functions

Window functions perform calculations across a set of table rows that are somehow related to the current row.

```sql
SELECT sale_id, product_id, amount,
       ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY product_id ORDER BY sale_date) as row_num
FROM sales;
```

### Nested Queries

Nested queries allow you to use the results of one query within another.

```sql
SELECT product_id, SUM(amount) as total_sales
FROM sales
WHERE sale_date IN (
  SELECT sale_date
  FROM sales
  WHERE amount > 1000
)
GROUP BY product_id;
```

## Performance Tuning Tips and Best Practices

### Limit Data Scanned

Use `LIMIT` to reduce the amount of data processed.

```sql
SELECT sale_id, product_id, amount
FROM sales
LIMIT 100;
```

### Use Predicate Pushdown

Ensure your filters are applied early in the query execution.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM sales
WHERE sale_date = '2021-01-01';
```

### Avoid SELECT \*

Specify only the columns you need to reduce data transfer.

```sql
SELECT sale_id, product_id, amount
FROM sales;
```

## Handling Large Result Sets

For large result sets, consider using the `CREATE TABLE AS SELECT` (CTAS) operation.

```sql
CREATE TABLE sales_2021 AS
SELECT *
FROM sales
WHERE sale_date BETWEEN '2021-01-01' AND '2021-12-31';
```

## Saving and Managing Queries

Use Athena's Saved Queries feature to store and manage your queries.

```sql
-- Save a query
SAVE QUERY AS 'Monthly Sales Report'
SELECT product_id, SUM(amount) as total_sales
FROM sales
WHERE sale_date BETWEEN '2021-01-01' AND '2021-01-31'
GROUP BY product_id;
```

## Monitoring and Troubleshooting

Use Athena's logs and metrics to monitor and troubleshoot queries.

- **CloudWatch Metrics**: Monitor query execution time, data scanned, and other metrics.
- **Query Execution Logs**: Review logs for detailed information on query execution.

```sql
-- Example: Check query execution details
SHOW QUERIES;


## Conclusion

By following the guidelines and best practices outlined in this document, you can write efficient and optimized queries in Amazon Athena, ensuring better performance and cost-effectiveness.
